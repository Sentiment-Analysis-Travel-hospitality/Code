# Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis

# Project Overview
This project utilizes sentiment analysis to classify and analyze customer reviews of hotels. The analysis helps identify positive and negative sentiments, offering insights that can enhance customer experience and service quality.

# Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Predict whether a review expresses positive or negative sentiment.
- **Data Processing**: Prepares and cleans review data for effective analysis.
- **Visualization**: Displays trends and patterns in customer sentiment through charts.
- **Model Training**: Uses machine learning techniques to train a sentiment analysis model.

# How It Works
1. **Input**: Customer reviews of hotels in a structured dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Text cleaning
   - Tokenization
   - Removing stopwords
3. **Model Training**: The processed text data is used to train a machine learning model.
4. **Prediction**: The model predicts the sentiment of new reviews as positive or negative.
5. **Output**: A visual and numerical analysis of the sentiments.
