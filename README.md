# **Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis Using DistilBERT**

## **Project Overview**
This project is centered on using sentiment analysis to understand customer reviews in the travel and hospitality industry. By analyzing hotel reviews, it identifies whether the feedback is positive or negative, helping businesses derive actionable insights to enhance customer experience. 

The project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and state-of-the-art transformer models such as DistilBERT to classify and process textual data effectively. This capability is essential for handling large-scale customer feedback, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions for service improvement.

## **Key Features**
1. **Sentiment Classification**  
   The project classifies customer reviews as positive or negative, providing valuable insights into customer satisfaction levels.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Reviews undergo a comprehensive cleaning process to standardize and prepare the data for analysis. This involves removing special characters, tokenizing text, and filtering out irrelevant content.

3. **Model Training and Fine-Tuning**  
   Using the DistilBERT model, the project adapts to the specific language patterns of hotel reviews, ensuring accurate sentiment detection.

4. **Visualization**  
   The project provides graphical representations of sentiment trends, model performance metrics, and sentiment distributions, making the findings easier to interpret.

## **How It Works**
### **Dataset Preparation**  
The project utilizes a dataset of approximately 38,932 labeled hotel reviews. Each review is categorized as positive or negative, reflecting the sentiments of customers about their experiences.

### **Data Cleaning**  
Before analysis, the raw text data is processed to remove noise such as special characters, redundant spaces, and stopwords. This ensures the model focuses on the meaningful aspects of the reviews.

### **Text Tokenization and Contextual Embeddings**  
The reviews are tokenized into smaller units and fed into the DistilBERT model, which generates contextual embeddings that capture the relationships and nuances in the text.

### **Model Training and Fine-Tuning**  
DistilBERT, a smaller and efficient version of BERT, is fine-tuned using the cleaned and tokenized dataset. The model learns to predict sentiment accurately by adjusting its weights based on labeled examples.

### **Prediction and Analysis**  
Once trained, the model predicts sentiments for new reviews. The results are visualized through charts and metrics, offering clear insights into customer feedback.
